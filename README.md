## Redux Fun
For this coding challenge, you'll be building an app using React and Redux that displays a list of users gathered from an api and a separate component displaying details from these users. We'd ask that you not use Clarity in the name to keep this more anonymous.

The api endpoint for this project is hosted at `https://immense-bastion-95145.herokuapp.com/api/users`. It responds with JSON and is unauthenticated.

Make sure to complete the following features:

1. Make a call to the api endpoint to fetch users (we'd like to see calls to the api handled by reducers)
2. Populate a list with these users. Use 'name' and 'company' fields
3. Add the functionality to select multiple users from the list and display the selected users info in another component. You may add fields to selected users

For Senior Positions
1. Please add some tests to this project (unit and/or acceptance)
2. We would like you to use a front end framework or styling of your choice to make the app look a little more finished

Feel free to approach this any way you like. We also realize that this state could be managed by component state, but we're looking to see how you'd handle this with Redux. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
