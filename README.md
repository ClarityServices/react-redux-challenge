## Redux Fun
For this coding challenge, you'll be building an app using React and Redux that displays a list of users gathered from an api and a separate component displaying details from these users. 

The api endpoint for this project is hosted at `https://immense-bastion-95145.herokuapp.com/api/users`. It responds with JSON and is unauthenticated.

Make sure to complete the following features:

1. Make a call to the api endpoint to fetch users
2. Populate a list with these users. Use 'name' and 'company' fields.
3. Add the functionality to select multiple users from the list and display the selected users info in another component. You may add fields to selected users.

Feel free to approach this any way you like, we aren't judging this on your UX/UI skills but go ahead if you'd like. We also realize that this state could be managed by component state, but we're looking to see how you'd manage this with Redux. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
